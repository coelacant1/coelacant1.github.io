# Software for Controlling Protogens!
* * *

If you are wondering how I control the faces on my Protogens, I wrote a program that I wrote called <a href="https://github.com/coelacant1/ProtoTracer" title="ProtoTracer Github"><i class="fa fa-github" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>[ProtoTracer](https://github.com/coelacant1/ProtoTracer). This program is free to use, fully open source, and up on GitHub! This software renders your Protogen's face as a 3D object that is being morphed in real time - using the exact same principles used to create rigged FBX avatars in VRChat. This gives you full control and allows you to maximize how expressive your Protogen is! I have a bit of documentation on both of [my Guides to help get you started!](./Guides.html)

If you have trouble or questions getting about ProtoTracer set up on your Protogen, feel free to join my <a href="https://www.discord.gg/YwaWnhJ" title="Discord"><i class="fa fa-brands fa-discord" aria-hidden="true"></i></a> [Discord server!](https://discord.com/invite/YwaWnhJ)
